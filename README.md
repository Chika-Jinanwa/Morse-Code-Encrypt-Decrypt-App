# Morse-Code-Encrypt-Decrypt-App
This is a GUI interactive python app built with tkinter that encrypts a plain text message to morse code and decrypts a morse code text into plain text. Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs. Morse code is named for Samuel Morse, an inventor of the telegraph. You can find more information about Morse code here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code
